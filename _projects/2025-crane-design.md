This project develops a compact 2D lifting mechanism that fits within a 150 cm × 50 cm design envelope and uses only one rigid bar, three pin supports, and a catalog linear actuator. The goal is to maximize both lifting capacity and vertical reach while keeping the system simple, buildable, and structurally efficient.

Design Summary

The mechanism consists of a rigid bar pinned to ground at one end (A), with the payload attached at the opposite tip. A linear actuator is mounted between a fixed ground pin (B) and a moving pin (C) on the bar, 40 cm from the pivot. As the actuator retracts, it rotates the bar upward through ~21°, raising the payload by 0.5 m (the maximum vertical travel allowed by the design box). Using the Tolomatic IMA55 roller-screw actuator, the system can lift up to ~8 kN (~815 kgf) safely within stroke limits.

The design provides a robust, high-capacity lifting motion using minimal components, with clear alignment, load transfer, and manufacturability considerations.
