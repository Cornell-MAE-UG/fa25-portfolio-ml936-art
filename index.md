## About Me


![Profile Picture]({{ "assets/images/profile-pic.jpg" | relative_url }}){: class="profile-image"}

 
My name is {{ site.name }}, and I am an architecture student in Cornell AAP. My interest is primarily with how can the innovative application of strcuture support the engagement between the built environment and the political, social discourse.

The built industry should free itself from the ego-centric pursuit of the eternal and embrace technology wholeheartedly. The fundamental subject of exploration is always "how things work." This portfolio reflects my passion with the mechanical, the technological, the structural, the certainty and the rational, the qualities that the building industry are lacking.
